Opened some new folders (mkdir) and created a new repo on github that I then cloned onto my machine (git clone). Did a "cd" into the correct directory and set up this readme file.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Created a clone of the google home page. There are definitely problems and I had a lot of trouble and looked up how to do pretty much everything but I got it done!
